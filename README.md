# ujjwalvaddepati

I am a software engineer with 14+ years of experience building robust, scalable, and resilient systems. My expertise spans across cloud infrastructure, system design, distributed systems, developer tooling, and full-stack product engineering.

Currently, I’m focused on architecting microservices at scale using AWS CDK, Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB, and New Relic observability. I’ve worked extensively on cloud-native payment gateways, multi-tenant SaaS platforms, and real-time messaging systems, driving initiatives in reliability, security, and performance.

🛠️ In recent years, I’ve:

Migrated critical payment systems from Stripe to Braintree with multi-currency and multi-merchant routing.
Led infrastructure-as-code transformations using AWS CDK with multi-env support (staging, prod).
Built a robust observability pipeline integrating Lambda logs with New Relic.
Scaled Kubernetes-based architectures using ElastiCache, Route53, and dynamic HPA strategies including scale-to-zero pods.

I enjoy solving deep engineering problems, documenting learnings, and sharing insights into system architecture, dev productivity, and financial independence.
